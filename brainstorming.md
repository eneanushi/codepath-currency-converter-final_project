Story: Creates a beneficial information source for all international students.

Market: Any new out-of-state student coming to the US for studies. This app would be beneficial, saving them a couple of thousand dollars per year and guiding them on the right path to education.

International students can also be available to work part-time during fall and spring and full time during the summer semester, as long as the job offer comes from the school or a company related to the student's major.
